## About Me

I am Ashot Aleksian, Ph.D. student at [Jean Monnet University](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr) in Saint-Étienne, France.

## Research Interests

Probability theory and stochastic analysis. In particular:
* **Stochastic Processes:** Itô diffusion, McKean-Vlasov process, Self-interacting diffusion.
* Metastability, exit-problem, Freidlin-Wentzell theory, Large Deviations Theory.

## News

- **[June 2023]** We finished a paper on the exit-time and exit-location problems for self-interacting diffusions in general case. Preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08706.pdf).
- **[June 2023]** Presentation of the new results about the exit-problem for self-interacting diffusion in general case on the workshop "Stochastic processes, metastability and applications" in Nancy, France.
- **[Mar. 2023]** We finished a paper solving the exit-problem for self-interacting diffusion in the case of convex confinement and interaction. Preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14997.pdf).
- **[Oct. 2022]** Presentation on the exit-time probelem on "First Franco-Japanese workshop on chemotaxis models (macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints)" in Sendai, Japan.
- **[May 2022]** Presentation on the workshop "Metastability, mean-field particle systems and nonlinear processes" in Saint-Étienne, France.
- **[Apr. 2021]** Start of the Sakura (Hubert Curien Program) project together with [Kentaro Fujie](http://www.math.tohoku.ac.jp/~fujie/main_eng.html), [Milica Tomasevic](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~milica.tomasevic/), [Julian Tugaut](https://tugaut.perso.math.cnrs.fr/research_grants.html), and [Hiroshi Wakui](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hiroshi-Wakui).
